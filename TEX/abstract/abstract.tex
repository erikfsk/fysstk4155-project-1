This report is based on a project assignment in the subject FYS-STK4155 at UiO.\cite{project1}
In this report the following regression methods were implemented; OLS, ridge and Lasso.
To understand how well our methods worked, we tested it against Scikit's solutions,
checked time dependance for different order of fitting and checked how noise affected the
resulting polynomial. Then our implementation, OLS, Ridge and Lasso, were used on the Franke function.
MSE,R2 score and VAR was calculated for all of the methods and how k-fold cross validation
affected to resulting polynomial is shown. After this had been done on the Franke function,
we repeated the proccedure for terrain data in Norway. The resulting polynomial were a good
approximation for general features for the data, but fell short to describe the details.
